## GPU-accelerated estimation of gene regulatory networks

Code base for gpuZoo: cost-effective estimation of gene regulatory networks using the Graphics Processing Unit. [doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqac002](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/4/1/lqac002/6524305?login=false)

### Introduction

gpuZoo is a GPU-accelerated implementation of PANDA, PUMA, SPIDER, and LIONESS to generate aggregate and single-sample gene regulatory networks.

This repository contains the code to generate the figures in the paper and the code for benchmarking gpuZoo in MATLAB and Python.

gpuZoo is available through [netZooM](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM) (> 0.5.2) with a step-by-step [tutorial](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM/tree/master/tutorials/gpuzoo) and [netZooPy](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy) > 0.6.2) with a step-by-step [tutorial](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy/tree/master/tutorials/gpupanda).

To download the data used for the benchmark, visit the [netZoo website](https://netzoo.github.io/zooanimals/gpuzoo/).
