## GPU-accelerated inference of gene regulatory networks

### Introduction

gpuPANDA and gpuLIONESS are GPU-accelerated implementation of PANDA and LIONESS to generate multi- and single-sample gene regulatory networks.

This repository contains the figure generation scripts and the code for benchmarking gpuPANDA and gpuLIONESS.

gpuPANDA and gpuLIONESS are available through [netZooM](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM) (> 0.4.3) with a step-by-step [tutorial](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM/tree/master/tutorials/gpu_panda_lioness) and [netZooPy](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy) > 0.6.2) with a step-by-step [tutorial].(https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy/tree/master/tutorials/gpupanda)

### Issues

Feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/QuackenbushLab/gpupanda/issues) if you have any comment about the benchmarks and [here](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM/issues)
